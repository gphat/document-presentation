Document-Presentation

Document::Presentation is an object representation of the elements that
make up a slide-based presentation.  The idea is that you create a
Document::Presentation object and repeatedly call add_slide with arguments.

The Theme allows you to use the same slides, but change up the look & feel.

It is expected that this won't be the method you use to actually _write_
presentations, as that's somewhat cumbersome.  This can, instead, be a target
for other formats (parse them and then them into Document::Presentations).
